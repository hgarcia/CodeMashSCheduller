    <Title>The case for Griffon: developing desktop applications for fun and profit</Title>
    <Abstract>Building a desktop application is a hard task, there are some many things to keep track of that many projects simply fail to meet their goals. Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application's life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development, there are so many traits shared by both frameworks that a Grails developer should be able to pick up the pace quickly.</Abstract>

    <Title>Convention over Configuration Applied to .Net</Title>
    <Abstract>At some point in the past year we finally realized that we can really apply the design concepts that make Ruby on Rails so great to .Net development. A plethora of OSS projects in the .Net space are exploiting &amp;quot;Convention over Configuration&amp;quot; to reduce friction in tool usage. In this talk I'd like to discuss some examples of CoC usage, how Conventions are applied, lessons learned, and a bit about creating your own conventions inside your application architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Title>Software Design and Testability</Title>
    <Abstract>There is undeniable value in doing automated testing, but the question is whether the benefits of automated testing are worth the time and manpower investment. The benefits and costs of automated testing are greatly affected by design and architecture choices. In this talk I will examine the real world design issues, patterns, and principles that can enhance or hinder testability.</Abstract>

    <Title>Building Dynamic Data Driven Applications, Part 1</Title>
    <Abstract>A number of technologies have been released in recent years which make building data driven applications easier. Starting with the declarative data models in LINQ and the Entity Framework, we are now able to build more dynamic applications quicker and easier than ever before. Building on top of LINQ, we now have the ability to present data dynamically through services (using ADO.Net Data Services) and web applications (using ASP.Net Dynamic Data). In both of these, we can consume our data models the way we need to rather than by needing constantly modify our external contracts (in terms of Stored Procedures or service contracts). The capabilities we have available to us are not limited to the base scaffolding, but allows for significant customization as necessary for our particular business needs. In addition, we can reuse our underlying models to enforce business requirements while retaining these dynamic capabilities. In Part 1, We'll focus on the data and services tiers.</Abstract>

    <Title>The Economics of Cloud Computing</Title>
    <Abstract>Return on Investment is key for large and small organizations in these risky times. A key mitigator of ROI risk is the avoidance of capital expenditure on IT infrastructure. While traditional Application Service Provider style hosting services do fit this bill, there is a new service on the horizon that has key benefits over the ASP model - cloud computing. Cloud computing leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user from details of the infrastructure, while spreading infrastructure capital expenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the realities of hosted applications, including the current popular ASP models, and compare them to cloud computing. There will be an overview of cloud computing architecture and strategy. He will end with a comparison of various commercial cloud services, including Google AppEngine, Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure.</Abstract>

    <Title>Oh Crap! I Forgot (or Never Learned) C!</Title>
    <Abstract>Chances are you code in a language that's either descended from C, inspired by C, or run in an interpreter that itself is written in C. Still... do you actually know how to code in C? Despite its long-standing position as a sort of &amp;quot;lingua franca&amp;quot;, an agreed-upon common language, more and more developers are putting together successful, satisfying careers, without ever learning this seminal language. But what if you have to call into C code from your favorite scripting language, or use APIs like OpenGL that are written to be called from C? Many developers find C very challenging, particularly its manual memory-management and other low-level concerns. In this session, we'll show you why you shouldn't be afraid of C, how you can use the skills you already have from the languages you code in today, and how to master structs, enums, typedefs, malloc(), free(), and the rest of C's sharp edges. Examples will be from the point-of-view of the C-skewing iPhone SDK, but will be designed to be broadly applicable and platform-agnostic.</Abstract>

In this session, we'll look at a grab-bag of some of the most popular and least obvious techniques you'll want in your developer's toolkit. These include:&lt;br&gt;* Designing custom table cells visually with Interface Builder, and using them in your app's tables&lt;br&gt;* Using buttons, switches and other controls inside table cells&lt;br&gt;* Animating changes in your GUI (rotation resizes, adding widgets, etc.)&lt;br&gt;* Gracefully handling interruptions from incoming calls&lt;br&gt;* Alerting the user with vibration&lt;br&gt;* Figuring out if your network connection is wifi or cellular&lt;br&gt;* Sharing information between applications you've written&lt;br&gt;* Building the &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lite&amp;quot; versions of your app from the same Xcode project and sources&lt;br&gt;* Running automated nightly builds from the command-line&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Title>Credit Crunch Code – Time to Pay Back the Technical Debt.</Title>
    <Abstract>Technical debt, the cost of putting off good development practices, can cripple a project's velocity, flexibility, and quality. This presentation will focus on a number of common anti-patterns such as &amp;quot;sensitive tests&amp;quot; which are brittle and overly coupled to odd situations which cause them to fail. Having identified these behaviours, we’ll look at techniques to firstly quantify the impacts via real world costing examples, after which we'll walk through mitigation strategies such as buying components of a solution versus developing everything from scratch. You'll leave this session with a better idea of how to avoid these pitfalls, and how to pull yourself out of them if you do end up therein.</Abstract>

    <Title>Sexier Software with Flex</Title>
    <Abstract>Building sexy software that users love is usually a challenging endeavor. The open source Flex SDK and your back-end of choice are a perfect combination of technologies for building rich, sexy software - for the web and the desktop. Flex applications can run in the browser using the ubiquitous Flash Player or on the desktop using Adobe AIR. In both instances your back-end of choice can be used for the server-side of the application. The communication between your back-end and Flex front-end can be a number of different communication protocols including SOAP, RESTful XML, JSON, and AMF. Using lots of live coding examples and demonstrations this session will cover the basics of using Flex to build sexy software for the web and the desktop.</Abstract>

    <Title>NoSQL: Death to Relational Databases!(?)</Title>
    <Abstract>There’s a storm brewing. You may have felt the increased pressure when you last typed “CREATE DATABASE latest_project;” into your MySQL console - or you might have been seeding the clouds in an attempt to bring the thunder on faster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name of that storm? NoSQL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New key-value stores seem to pop up daily, document databases like CouchDB and MongoDB get a great deal of press, and RDF itself is built as a graph database. Given that, and the fact that a number of domains just don’t map onto relational databases very cleanly, it behooves the development community to learn about these alternatives. How do they differ from relational databases? In what situations are they best used? How hard is it to split up a domain model into, say, a relational piece and a document piece - and is this ever worthwhile?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll answer those questions in this session, and I’ll refer to actual problem domains while illustrating the answers. As it turns out, a document DB like CouchDB works very well for modeling biological taxonomy - and a graph DB like Neo4J is a great fit for the (surprisingly complex) business of comic books. The NoSQL future is wide, varied, and exciting - and it might even have a place for our old friends, the relational DBs.&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Abstract>WPF and Silverlight demos that bind the &amp;quot;View&amp;quot; directly to the &amp;quot;Model&amp;quot; are nice for small applications. For real-world applications, however, this way of writing software quickly falls apart. The&lt;br&gt;Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern has gained popularity for testability, de-coupling and configurability. Learn about the MVVM pattern with code-driven demos that show how to properly separate the &amp;quot;View&amp;quot; from the &amp;quot;Model&amp;quot;.</Abstract>

    <Title>Source Control for People Who Don't Like Source Control</Title>
    <Abstract>Few tools have changed the way I work as much as the git source control system. Its distributed nature and lightweight branching and merging have made it possible for me to massage my code base in ways I couldn't have even imagined before using git.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, git has a reputation for being hard to learn. Because of its rather different approach to source control issues, many of the techniques we have learned in other source control systems do not translate cleanly when using git.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this talk, we avoid the whole &amp;quot;fear of git&amp;quot; issue by not talking about git at all. Instead we introduce the &amp;quot;Custom Source Control&amp;quot; (CSC) system and build it up from first principles. In the end, we will ahve a completely functional, distributed source control system. And because each step in our journey of building CSC is simple and straight forward, we end up with a completely understandable system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, this talk is not about git. But attendees will end up with a deeper understanding of the principles behind git.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did I mention this talk is not about git? No, really! It's not. &amp;lt;wink/&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Title>Testing Java on the Fast Lane</Title>
    <Abstract>The Java platform ecosystem harbors many languages besides Java. In that vast set of languages there is one that has received the title of “Next Generation Java” but not because it dismisses Java, not at all! it is because it embraces the language and extends it in a friendly and fluent way. That language is Groovy. Testing Java code can be cumbersome, specially when rigid limits as verbose syntax and static typing get in the way. Groovy can help you write less code while retaining the same behavior, it can also test your Java production code without any special bridge between languages. Groovy integrates seamlessly with all Java libraries, testing frameworks and IDEs, which means you won’t be throwing away your Java knowledge, you’ll just make it groovier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This session will demonstrate Groovy aiding Java tests in key areas as code verbosity, mocking and producing/consuming XML. </Abstract>

And yet with every single day that passes these terms race closer to ubiquity. Heck, my grandmother recently tried to &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; me on Facebook. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet despite this popularity, very few people really know what these terms represent. More importantly, the underlying concepts they represent when actually building a social application. So, as businesses choose to build or integrate these social features into their products, designers and developers are faced with a challenge on where to start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This talk is going to walk through the history of the social software movement and introduce the audience to the core underlying concepts and methodologies for both designing and developing social applications.

Duration: 60-90 minutes&lt;br&gt;
Subject Area: ASP.NET, Web Development, Patterns and Practices&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction&lt;br&gt;Model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that has been around for thirty years used to isolate business logic from input and presentation. While there have been open-source MVC frameworks for .NET, the recently released Microsoft ASP.NET MVC framework implements the MVC pattern using ASP.NET, making it readily available to all developers on the Microsoft platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This session starts at File - New, and creates an ASP.NET MVC project. In addition to covering controllers and views, unit testing (using NUnit), dependency injection (using StructureMap), and data access (using LINQ and NHibernate) will also be covered. Best practices will also be presented to help avoid mistakes while adapting to this not-so-new style of web application development.</Abstract>

    <Title>Building iPhone and Android applications with Titanium Mobile</Title>
    <Abstract>So, you're a web ninja. You've mastered CSS, XHTML, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Django and are pretty sure that HTML 5 is going to render Silverlight and Flex completely useless. You're so 1337 that lesser developers cower at your web development prowess. Then someone asks you to create an iPhone app or Andriod app or Mac Desktop app or a Windows Desktop app... you're starting to sweat at the thought of quirky platform specific languages and behavior. FEAR NOT, CITIZEN! A new open source framework by Appcelerator called Titanium allows you to use your incredible web skills to create cross platform, desktop and mobile applications. Come spend some time learning about this new framework while we take a lap around the basics of the framework and create a simple mobile application that can run on either Apple's iPhone or Google's Andriod OS! (Tech used: Titanium Mobile, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS)</Abstract>

    <Title>Looting Design Ideas from the World of Warcraft</Title>
    <Abstract>The World of Warcraft (WoW) is today's most popular MMORPG, with 11.5 million subscribers generating an estimated $120+ million in monthly revenue for Blizzard Entertainment. Besides being a very successful video game, WoW can also be examined as a case study for creating interesting and scalable applications. In this session, we will demonstrate a handful of features found in WoW, including end-user interface customization using APIs and add-ons, presence awareness, realtime communication between users, data caching, and offline access to application data. For each feature, we will investigate ways to build similar functionality into your own LOB application using tools and technologies available today for free.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Funky Java, Objective Scala&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Session Title: Funky Java, Objective Scala&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tagline: Polyglot programming is here, and can improve your style. Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your Java, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, while the Java platform has been going from strength to strength, improving both performance and support for alternative languages, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today's Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7. Topics covered will include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immutable value classes&lt;br&gt;Builder pattern and fluent APIs&lt;br&gt;Typesafe &amp;quot;Multiple returns&amp;quot; with Pairs and Triples&lt;br&gt;Predicates, functions, constraints, identity maps and more with the Google Collections Library&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, alternative languages that offer much more than Java are emerging on the JVM. Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it's easy access improvements. Along the way, some functional techniques will be introduced where they make sense, and where they make life easier. This is intended to be like easing into a warm swimming pool rather than diving in at the deep end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aimed at beginner and intermediate developers, this session aims to help you improve your productivity and coding style.&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Title>Testing ASP.net applications using Ruby</Title>
    <Abstract>The Ruby community has always understood the importance of testing. They strive to make applications more testable while improving the approaches and tools they use. As a result, they have created some amazing frameworks and best practices to support testing, both from the developers and testers point of view. While this is great for Ruby developers, it also is extremely beneficial for ASP.net and C# developers. This session provides an insight into the Ruby world and how you can take advantage of the existing frameworks to create readable, maintainable and valuable acceptance tests for ASP.net based web applications testing different parts of the application including the business logic as well as the user interface in an automated fashion. The session will explain how frameworks such as RSpec and Cucumber can be used to verify not only that the application works as expected, but the customers are receiving the features they require with a correct implementation. Finally, Ben will look at IronRuby and how that fits into the process of testing C#\ASP.net applications using the Ruby language. </Abstract>

    <Title>Seeing Constraints, Kanban Explained</Title>
    <Abstract>I have been practicing and coaching on kanban for 10 months now. I am passionate about kanban because without a lot of ceremony and time, I can get a team to self organize and start communicating. Since constraints become visible, it allows people to be more willing to go out of their comfort zone and thus wear any hat that it takes to produce quality software. Seeing constraints, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practicing kanban. This would be a &amp;quot;kanban explained&amp;quot; session for those who are not familiar with this practice. I use physical boards to illustrate the concepts and encourage good dialogue. We will discuss several types of kanban boards such as WIP, backlog and retrospectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This presentation has been tested at many user group meetings, at clients and in the open space forum at Agile 2009. The session takes 1 hour to present, 1 1/2 hours to have good dialogue during the presentation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanban, while not a new concept, nor complex - it is often misunderstood by those who don't practice it. Intended audience is for people that understand agile story wall concepts and whole team. The best audience is a Scrum master who will learn how kanban can take their craft to the next level of a self organizing teams by seeing, not hearing about constraints.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>The Rails Rumble is a 48-hour innovation competition in which teams of up to four developers embrace their environmental constraints to create a number of compelling microapps with Ruby and Rails. In this panel we’ll talk to a number of Rumble participants and discover the tips, tricks, and techniques they used to successfully launch innovative web properties in an extremely short time frame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panelists will include a number of winners and other developers/designers who performed impressive feats during both the 2007, 2008, and 2009 contests. Questions will be taken before the conference starts, but attendees should come prepared with lots of questions for the panelists, such as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How they leveraged Rails and open source software to help them succeed.&lt;br&gt;How they scoped their projects and structured their applications to enable them to launch early and iterate often.&lt;br&gt;How they embraced the mantra of “simplest thing that could possibly work”, removing extraneous features and setting reasonable goals for themselves.&lt;br&gt;How they found partners whose skills complemented their own, and how they organized their team.&lt;br&gt;General productivity tips and work habit recommendations.&lt;br&gt;Their advice will be applicable to both future innovation competitions (such as the upcoming Rails Rumbles) as well as to any project that attendees may hope to bootstrap in their own copious spare time. We’ll also discuss how to get involved with innovation competitions and why their condensed nature and marketing opportunities can be a great motivator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panelists include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Penn - winner 2008&lt;br&gt;Jim Weirich - participant 2008&lt;br&gt;Josh Schramm - participant 2009&lt;br&gt;Matt Yoho - participant 2009&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moderated by:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Fiorini&lt;br&gt;Josh Walsh&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Abstract>In large organizations, it's common for an application to start out as small and &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; to morph into some large behemoth that is critical to a business function. As code is tacked on to this application it becomes harder and harder to maintain and troubleshoot. Enter Prism, the Composite Application Guidance for WPF and Silverlight. Using Prism gives you the guidance and foundation assemblies that will produce a functionally modular application that is testable, maintainable and evolvable. This talk will give an overview of Prism, benefits of it's use, and when it makes sense to use it.</Abstract>

    <Title>SOLID Ruby</Title>
    <Abstract>The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that improve an Object Oriented design. They are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Single Responsibility Principle&lt;br&gt;* Open/Closed Princip&lt;br&gt;* Liskov Substitution Principle&lt;br&gt;* Interface Segregation Principle&lt;br&gt;* Dependency Inversion Principle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The SOLID principles were written with a statically typed language (such as C++ or Java) in mind. What do the SOLID principles mean to a dynamic/flexible language like Ruby? This talk will focus on how SOLID and Ruby interact, how to create well designed Ruby software, and to suggest possibilities for new design principles for dynamic languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 5 SOLID design principles form a great foundation for understanding good Object Oriented design. But the SOLID principles were originally conceived with statically typed OO languages, such as C++ and Java, in mind. How well do these principles hold up when the implementation language is Ruby? Are the principles just as pertinent as they were in Java, or does the dynamic nature of Ruby change what we mean by good design? In this presentation we will examine the SOLID principles to understand their core purpose, and then run them through the &amp;quot;Ruby Filter&amp;quot; to see if any of these core principles survive. By understanding these principles, we become better Ruby programmers.&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Title>What Makes Ruby Different</Title>
    <Abstract>You have heard about Ruby. You have heard about Ruby on Rails. What you have not seen is how they are different from the tools you are using. This talk is about code. C#, Java and Ruby, side-by-side, solving the same problems you face daily. This talk is focused solely on how the languages are different - beyond the surface of syntax and into the heart of design. We will show the difference between a purely object-oriented language and a class based language. We will show you what problem an IOC container solves, and why you don't need one in Ruby. This talk is not about selling a language, but comparing them. This is not about demonstrating features, but demonstrating benefits in real world code examples. </Abstract>

    <Title>Going Dynamic with C#</Title>
    <Abstract>C# might be looking a little long in the tooth, but C# 4.0 adds dynamic support to compete with all the young punks. In this session, based on material from Effective C#, 2nd edition, you’ll learn how to mix dynamic features into the safety and performance of static typing. It’s yet another tool in the toolbox that you can use with C#. You’ll learn techniques that are easier to implement using dynamic features. You’ll learn how to bridge the gap between dynamic and static typing. Most of all you’ll learn when dynamic typing is an advantage, and when static typing provides the best solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Abstract>While the big players like Yahoo, Twitter, and Google provide API's for their services, not all sites have seen that light yet. This talk presents a methodology to add and publish a REST API to sites that do not provide their own. It covers design, implementation, testing, and best practices using a case-study. A basic understanding of Django and HTTP will be helpful.</Abstract>

    <Title>Engineering vs Design - How to work together</Title>
    <Abstract>In many companies, there is a separation of &amp;quot;church and state&amp;quot; between engineering and design (visual/interaction). For today's onslaught of rich internet applications, this separation can cause tension and/or lead to less than ideal applications. How do you work together? How do you get great and innovative UI design to cleanly pair with great software architecture and execution? This talk will collect the experiences from my career, and culminate in a system that works to deliver the best from both worlds.</Abstract>

    <Title>Get Higher with ScalaTest</Title>
    <Abstract>Newer JVM languages such as JRuby, Groovy, and Scala let you work at a higher level than Java. This talk will show you ScalaTest, a new testing tool that will let you work at a higher level than JUnit and TestNG. You'll learn about high-level features of Scala such as traits and self-types, implicit conversions and parameters, functions and closures, and internal DSLs, and see how ScalaTest exploits these features to help you work more productively. You'll see how you can reduce the lines of test code you write by half and more, how to mix Scala into your existing JUnit or TestNG infrastructure, and how to use Scala in various testing styles, including unit testing, behavior-driven development, integration and acceptance testing, and high-level property-based testing. You need not already know Scala to attend this talk, as you will be taught just enough Scala to understand the examples.</Abstract>

    <Title>User Stories: Closing the Agile Loop</Title>
    <Abstract>A large number of Agile adoption initiatives start at a grassroots level among software developers who have grown uncomfortable with the blatant inefficiencies of classic approaches to software development. The teams who succeed often find themselves working more efficiently, but the impact of their success is hindered. They are still relegated to taking large functional specifications and digesting them into iterations of work, with little if any feedback from the business side of the house. A series of successful sprints can still be met with the cliche &amp;quot;that's not what we wanted&amp;quot; response, leaving development teams relegated to the &amp;quot;well that's what you wrote&amp;quot; response. Until the business people are participating in iterative feedback and realizing the flexibility and freedom they have in working with these Agile teams, there will always be a ceiling on their success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attendees of this talk will be guided through pragmatic, proven approaches for building that bridge to the business representatives. A thorough treatment of how user stories can be used as an effective tool that allows business and development sides of the house to meet in the middle, as well as when and how to bend in order to move the adoption process forward. It will also cover the sometimes subtle pitfalls and hotspots of promoting a fully Agile process with participating business team members, and ways to hopefully allow good deeds to continue to go unpunished.</Abstract>

    <Title>Domain-Driven Design: An Introduction</Title>
    <Abstract>The first book on Domain-Driven Design was published in 2003, authored by Eric Evans, who first coined the term and distilled the time-tested principles and patterns that make up the practice of DDD. In recent years, simplification and increased testability through frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and others has substantially reduced the complexity of application infrastructure, allowing teams to turn their focus to honing their approach to software design. Domain-Driven Design meets practitioners in that quest with principles, practices, and process to recapture the spirit of software excellence that has been lost in so many of today's technology practices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This talk will introduce the foundations of Domain-Driven Design, and present several facets of DDD in action:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* How models are chosen and evaluated&lt;br&gt;* How multiple models coexist&lt;br&gt;* How patterns help to avoid common pitfalls, such as overly-interconnected models&lt;br&gt;* How developers and domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper exploration of their problem domain and make that understanding tangible as a practical software design</Abstract>

This includes the aspects of cutting graphics out of PSD files and a bit of HTML/CSS to make things look right. The emphasis will be on getting stuff out of Photoshop, and assumes some CSS knowledge.</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Let go of your fear! In this fun and interactive session participants will learn the benefits of following respected patterns of interactive design to reduce waste and get fast feedback on initial designs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This session will cover concerns regarding intellectual property (IP), and identify guidelines to help developers determine where the line is between studying and stealing. We will emphasize the benefits of learning from others vs. creating an interface from scratch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competitive analysis will be covered in depth as a quick, easy (and safe) way to determine what features are commonly provided to users. By studying these existing standards the project’s inventory of requirements will be representative of the users expectations. The resulting interface will benefit from others experience and ideas, without endangering the organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This session will also explore additional methods that can improve software development by providing accurate information about users. Paper prototyping (low fidelity prototypes put in front of users) will be explored as a way to get fast feedback saves time and resources by allowing the team to iterate quickly based on the feedback without starting actual development.</Abstract>

    <Title>An Introduction to MongoDB</Title>
    <Abstract>MongoDB is an open-source, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. The goal of the MongoDB project is to bridge the functionality gap between a key/value store and a traditional RDBMS. This talk will introduce MongoDB and discuss some of the reasons why MongoDB might be the right fit for your project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll introduce MongoDB by explaining how it compares to traditional relational databases as well as some other non-relational systems. This will focus on the gains in scalability and flexiblity that make MongoDB an attractive option, as well as some examples of when MongoDB might not be the best fit. Following this introduction we will discuss some specific use cases for MongoDB. This will include examples of interacting with MongoDB from several different languages. We will review some of the advanced features of MongoDB and discuss how they can be put to good use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Questions and discussion will be encouraged throughout the presentation, but some time will be allotted at the end specifically for Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notes: &lt;br&gt;- I filed this under Architecture and Design, but wasn't really sure where exactly it belonged. If you think it belongs in a different track feel free to adjust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- I also filed under Other Languages because there was no &amp;quot;All Languages&amp;quot; category. There are MongoDB drivers for all of the listed languages (and more), so the talk really applies to developers working in any of them.</Abstract>

    <Title>Clojure: Concurrent Functional Programming for the JVM</Title>
    <Abstract>Talk about strange bedfellows: what happens when you mix one part Lisp&lt;br&gt;(one of the oldest computer languages), one part Java (so young, yet&lt;br&gt;so well adopted), a healthy serving of functional programming, and a&lt;br&gt;state-of-the-art concurrency layer on top? That's Clojure, which&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;feels like a general-purpose language beamed back from the near&lt;br&gt;future.&amp;quot; Clojure embraces functional programming with immutable data&lt;br&gt;types and first class functions. It is fully interoperable with&lt;br&gt;Java. Clojure's approach to concurrency includes asynchonous Agents,&lt;br&gt;and Software Transactional Memory. Clojure is fast, elegant, dynamic,&lt;br&gt;and scalable: a language for the future, today.&lt;br&gt;</Abstract>

    <Abstract>Developers spend way too much of their time performing tedious and error prone tasks as part of their day to day work. Manual code reviews, waiting on slow and broken builds, fixing tests gone wild, firefighting scary releases--it never ends. But, fear not! There are tools and techniques for building a disciplined automated environment to rescue the developer, increase productivity and reduce monotony.  This session will briefly espouse the need for source control and issue tracking, but the focus will be primarily on what it takes to create high quality automatable builds and tests, and how to get them automated. Lessons learned while at Google and Netflix will be shared, as well as experience with a few specific products in key categories.</Abstract>
